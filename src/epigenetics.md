# Epigenetics

Epigenetics is the modification of the gene expression though the modification of the histone proteins and the methylation of some cytosine residues in the genomic DNA. Simply put these factors can provide an on/off switch for transcription, impacting the dynamics of the transcription network.

Epigenetics process are considered key determinants that lead to different diseases. 

Histone acetylation can suppress the gene. DNA methylation of cytosine (C) can suppress or activate the gene

Stem cells have more methylated CpG islands than somatic cells, thus  it is an important mechanism for specialisation of stem cells. 

Epigenetics can be seen as another component in a complex boolean network

Cytosine methylation is inherited, thus defining some inherited diseases. This has led it to be considered as a fifth nucleic base in the genome
